			<h2>I believe a good website comes as the result of good planning.</h2>
			<p> I think <em>really</em> good planning occurs when the design and development process are integrated and complement each other.</p>
			<p>I have a passion for learning and problem solving. I think it's my innate curiosity that drives me to try and understand how web technologies work, or why a layout is successful.</p>
			<p>I come from a background as a classically trained painter. With that comes a love of technical craft. From a work of art to a snippet of code, I think <em>how</em> something is constructed contributes to its meaning, and amplies its functionality.</p>
			<p>I am a graduate from MCTCâ€™s web and interactive media program. I am always looking for new challenges and excited to continue to learn as part of a dynamic team.</p>
